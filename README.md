# -Banking-Chatbot-using-Rasa
This repository contains the implementation of a Banking Chatbot using the open-source machine learning framework Rasa. The chatbot has the capability to understand and respond to a user's queries regarding their account balance, transaction history, and more.
This project is an example of how we can create intelligent and responsive chatbots using the power of Rasa and machine learning. It can be extended and adapted to various use-cases and serves as a good starting point for anyone interested in chatbot development.

Usage:

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

Install the necessary dependencies.

Run rasa train to train the bot.

Start the action server in a new terminal window with rasa run actions.

In another terminal, run rasa shell to start the chatbot.

This project is under active development. Contributions are welcome!
